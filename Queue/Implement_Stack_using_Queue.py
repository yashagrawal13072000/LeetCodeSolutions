# Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

# Implement the MyStack class:

# void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
# int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
# int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
# boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
# Notes:

# You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

    def __init__(self):
