# There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

# You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). 
# All integers in positions are unique.

# All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. 
# If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.

# If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. 
# The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.

# Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given,
# i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

# Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

# Note: The positions may be unsorted.
