# Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps. 
# Each unique message should only be printed at most every 10 seconds (i.e. a message printed at timestamp t will prevent other identical messages from being printed until timestamp t + 10).

# All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

# Implement the Logger class:

# Logger() Initializes the logger object.
# bool shouldPrintMessage(int timestamp, string message) Returns true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, 
# otherwise returns false.

class Logger:

    def __init__(self):
        self.history = {}

    def shouldPrintMessage(self, timestamp: int, message: str) -> bool:
        if message in self.history and timestamp - self.history[message] < 10:
            return False
        else:
            self.history[message] = timestamp
            return True


# Your Logger object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Logger()
# param_1 = obj.shouldPrintMessage(timestamp,message)
