# A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.

# A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

# A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

# Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

# Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance]
# where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the 
# maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
