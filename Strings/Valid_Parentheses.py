# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

# An input string is valid if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
